        Hello! Thank you for exploring my page. My name is William Hirst and I
        am a part time coding student. I have worked several jobs and have
        attained a Bachelor Of Art's Degree in Psychology from Rutgers. I have a
        passion for technology and coding and am very excited to be on this
        journey. My background makes me rather diverse in terms of my
        perspective on things and I take nothing for granted. Please look around
        my page and once again thank you for being here.
